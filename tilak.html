	<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
	<p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), is a former international cricketer who captained the Indian national cricket team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is currently the captain of Chennai
		Super Kings (CSK), a franchise based team of Indian Premier League. Having won the triple ICC limited-overs tournament as captain (inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy) and bringing Indian
		cricket team to number one position in ICC test rankings in 2009,[3] Dhoni is often considered as the greatest captain of Indian cricket team. Furthermore, he led CSK to win 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021 edition of IPL, becoming second most
		successful IPL captain after Rohit Sharma.</p>


	<h2> ODI CAREER</h2>
	<p>The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent.[57] The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like
		Parthiv Patel and Dinesh Karthik (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.[57] With Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.[58] Dhoni did not have a great start to
		his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut.[59] In spite of an average series against Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.</p>

	<h2> TEST CAREER</h2>
	<p>Following his good one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the Indian teams' Test wicket-keeper.[116] Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain. Dhoni came to the crease
		when the team was struggling at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling around him, he played an aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed.[117] Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second Test and his quick scoring rate
		(half century came off 51 balls) helped India set a target of 436 and the Sri Lankans were bowled out for 247.</p>

	<h2>T20I CAREER </h2>
	<p>On 12 February 2012, Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide India to their first win over Australia at Adelaide. In the final over, he hit a monstrous six which travelled 112 meters off the bowling of Clint McKay. During the post-match presentation,
		he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup final in 2011.He was named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2014 T20 World Cup by the ICC.[129]</p>
